Simple Shapefile -> CityGML LoD4 conversion
================================================

Testing the CityGML library to create cuboid LoD4 building models from shapefiles. A Level of Detail 2 (LoD 2) building block is extruded from a shapefile. The block is then populated with LoD 4 rooms taken from a separate shapefile.
